# Blue Point Art - Virtual Gallery Archive

Welcome to the Virtual Gallery Archive for [Blue Point Art](https://bluepointart.uk) â€“ a modular, evolving platform for curating, viewing, and experiencing digital exhibitions.

## Overview

The archive provides a modular structure for virtual exhibitions, enabling artists and curators to showcase work in an interactive 3D environment. The core of the project is a **gallery viewer built with Three.js**, allowing immersive navigation and dynamic exhibition design.

## Features

* **Modular Architecture:**
  Exhibitions are driven by customizable configuration files (`config.json`), making setup and expansion straightforward.

* **Gallery Viewer:**
  Built on [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), the viewer is the foundation for exploring virtual exhibitions.

* **Decentralized Assets:**
  All gallery assets (images, models, videos) are stored on [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) for permanence and global accessibility.

## Roadmap

1. **Current:**

   * Gallery viewer with modular config-based exhibitions

2. **Coming Next:**

   * **VR Support:** Step into exhibitions using VR headsets
   * **WebXR Projects:** Host and archive advanced interactive and spatial artworks
   * **Spatial Documentation:** Tools for archiving and presenting digital spatial projects

3. **Future Directions:**
